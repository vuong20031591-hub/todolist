## Overview
The Todo Priority feature allows users to assign different priority levels to each todo item.
This helps users focus on important tasks first and manage their time more effectively.

## Priority Levels
Each todo can have one of the following priority levels:

- **High**: Urgent and important tasks that should be completed as soon as possible.
- **Medium**: Important tasks that are not urgent but still need attention.
- **Low**: Optional or less important tasks that can be done later.

## Functional Description
- Users can select a priority level when creating a todo.
- Users can update the priority of an existing todo.
- Todos can be sorted based on priority.
- Priority is displayed clearly in the todo list.

## Example
- Finish assignment → High  
- Review lecture notes → Medium  
- Clean workspace → Low  

## Benefits
- Improves task organization
- Helps users identify urgent tasks quickly
- Enhances productivity and planning
## Notes
Priority levels can be extended in the future to support custom user-defined priorities.
